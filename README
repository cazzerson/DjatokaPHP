Based heavily on work in Ruby by Jason Ronallo:

Documentation coming soon. For now, look at the tests and the codes. This library supports some interactions with the Djatoka image server, and uses a method-chaining design. It also currently supports the generation some pre-defined image square crops (top_left, center, bottom_right), as well as edge-trimming of these crops. Play around and let me know if you notice any problems or have any ideas for improvements.
